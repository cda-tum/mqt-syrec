Welcome to the documentation of the SyReC Synthesizer!
=================================

The *SyReC Synthesizer* is a tool for HDL-based synthesis of reversible circuits developed as part of the
*Munich Quantum Toolkit* (*MQT*) by the `Chair for Design Automation <https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/>`_ at the
`Technical University of Munich <https://www.tum.de>`_.

We recommend you to start with the :doc:`installation instructions <Installation>`.
Then proceed to read the :doc:`reference documentation <library/Library>`.
If you are interested in the theory behind *SyReC Synthesizer*, have a look at the publications in the :doc:`publication list <Publications>`.

We appreciate any feedback and contributions to the project. If you want to contribute, you can find more information in
the :doc:`Contribution <Contributing>` guide. If you are having trouble with the installation or the usage of *SyReC Synthesizer*,
please let us know at our :doc:`Support <Support>` page or by reaching out to us at
`quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de <mailto:quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de>`_.

Semantics of the SyReC language
===============================
Both the original paper introducing the syntax and first semantic properties of the SyReC language :cite:p:`wille2016syrec` and the RevLib project :footcite:p:`wille2008revlib` adding some further semantic properties will serve as references for the remainder of this page and we are assuming that the reader has read the relevant sections in both documents before continuing. The goal of this document is to not only specify original semantics of the language SyReC but also include extensions where a reference specification was missing or left room for interpretation.

.. note::
  While the SyReC parser implements the semantics specified on this page, some properties might only be valid for this project due to the previously mentioned gaps in the reference specification.

We start by defining the semantics of the highest-level entity of a SyReC program, a so called *Module*, and work our way down to the most basic elements of the language:

Module
------
- The RevLib project (v2.0.1, section 2.1) :footcite:p:`wille2008revlib` states that the entry point of a well-formed SyReC program is either defined explicitly by a module with an identifier *main* or is implicitly chosen as the last defined module of the program.

- Omitting the specification of the dimensionality of any variable (i.e., the number of dimensions and the number of values per dimension) will cause the variable to be considered as a 1D variable storing a single value; The following example shows the two equivalent specifications:

 .. code-block:: text

   // Omitting dimensionality of variable 'a'
   module main(inout a(4))
    ...

   // Explicit specification of dimensionality of variable 'a'
   module main(inout a[1](4))
    ...

- The value of every variable with bitwidth :math:`b` is assumed to be an unsigned integer and thus must be in the range :math:`[0, 2^b]`.
- The maximum supported bitwidth of any variable is equal to 32.
- Omitting the bitwidth of a variable will lead to the assumption that its bitwidth is equal to a :doc:`configurable default value <library/Settings>`.
- The parameter and variable identifiers must be unique in a SyReC module.
- Module overloading (i.e., the definition of a module sharing its identifier with another module while the structure [variable type, dimensionality and bitwidth] of their parameters do not match) is supported for all modules whose identifier is not equal to *main*. However, overloading the implicitly defined main module of a SyReC program is possible.

 | Two module signatures (module identifier + parameters) :math:`m_1` and :math:`m_2` are considered to be equal iff:

   - The module identifiers match
   - Both modules define the same number of parameters :math:`n`
   - For each parameter :math:`i: 0 \leq i < n` in the sequence of the formal parameters of both modules the following holds:
        - The type of parameter :math:`p_i` of module :math:`m_1` allows for an assignment of the parameter at the same position in the formal parameter list of module :math:`m_2` with the following table listing the assignability between the different SyReC variable types:
            +-----------------------------------------------+-------+---------+-------+--------+---------+
            |                                               | **Assigned from variable type**            |
            +-----------------------------------------------+-------+---------+-------+--------+---------+
            | **Assigned to variable type**                 | *in*  | *inout* | *out* | *wire* | *state* |
            +-----------------------------------------------+-------+---------+-------+--------+---------+
            | *in*                                          | X     | X       | X     | X      | X       |
            +-----------------------------------------------+-------+---------+-------+--------+---------+
            | *inout*                                       | o     | X       | X     | X      | o       |
            +-----------------------------------------------+-------+---------+-------+--------+---------+
            | *out*                                         | o     | X       | X     | X      | o       |
            +-----------------------------------------------+-------+---------+-------+--------+---------+
            | *wire*                                        | o     | X       | X     | X      | o       |
            +-----------------------------------------------+-------+---------+-------+--------+---------+
            | *state*                                       | o     | o       | o     | o      | o       |
            +-----------------------------------------------+-------+---------+-------+--------+---------+
            | o ... does not allow assignment                                                            |
            |                                                                                            |
            | X ... allows assignment                                                                    |
            +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
        - The number of dimensions match
        - The number of values for each of the defined dimensions matches
        - The bitwidth of the parameters match

 The signature of a module is expected to be unique in a SyReC program.

- The maximum number of values storable in a dimension is equal to :math:`2^{32}`.
- A variable can have at most :math:`2^{32}` dimensions.
- The bitwidth of a variable must be larger than zero.
- The number of values for any dimension of a variable must be larger than zero.
- Variables of type 'state' require special handling and are treated as read-only in a SyReC program with the initial state being set during synthesis.
  Both of the available SyReC specifications, namely the original SyReC paper :footcite:p:`wille2016syrec` as well as in the RevLib documentation :footcite:p:`wille2008revlib`, only mention potential use-cases but fail to specify how the value transitions for these variables should be implemented.
  Thus, the support for 'state' variables in SyReC should be considered as prototypical with future version potentially offering better support or more concise specifications of the expected semantics.

Statements
----------
Assignments
^^^^^^^^^^^
- To guarantee the reversibility of any assignment, the assigned-to variable parts cannot be accessed on the "other" (right-hand side of a non-unary assignment or left/right side of a variable swap) of the assignment. While this restriction is applied to all *VariableAccesses* on the "other" side of the assignment, the restriction does not apply to the *VariableAccesses* defined in the dimension access of any *VariableAccess*. The parser can only detect an overlap between two *VariableAccess* instances :math:`l_{varA}` and :math:`r_{varA}` if the following conditions hold:

  .. note::
   Loop variables are not evaluated to their current value in the following checks

  - The identifier of the accessed variables match
  - Assuming that :math:`l_{varA}` defines the indices :math:`l_{dimIdxs} = \{l_1, l_2, \dots, l_n\}` in its dimension access while :math:`r_{varA}` accesses the indices :math:`r_{dimIdxs} = \{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n\}`, an overlap in the :math:`i`-th dimension is detected iff:
        - Both :math:`l_i` and :math:`r_i` evaluate to a constant at compile time and :math:`l_i = r_i`
        - An overlap was detected for all indices :math:`j` at positions :math:`0 < j < i` in the sequence of indices of the dimension accesses

          .. note::
           Note that only :math:`min(len(l_{dimIdxs}), len(r_{dimIdxs}))` indices of the dimension accesses are checked
  - If an overlap in the dimension access was detected, the accessed bitranges of :math:`l_{varA}` (represented by the pair (:math:`l_{bitS}`, :math:`l_{bitE}`)) and of :math:`r_{varA}` (represented by (:math:`r_{bitS}`, :math:`r_{bitE}`)) are checked for an overlap using the following conditions:
        - All indices in both bitranges evaluate to constants and an overlap between the two ranges is detected.
        - A bit of each *VariableAccess* evaluates to a constant and their values match.
        - A bit of one *VariableAccess* evaluates to a constant while both indices of the accessed bit range of the other *VariableAccess* evaluate to constants athen n overlap is reported if the bit range with known bounds overlaps said bit.

    .. note::
     Out-of-range index values are not treated differently than values that are in range.
     A not specified bit range access of a *VariableAccess* is assumed to access the full bitwidth of the referenced variable.

- While access on the assigned-to variable parts is, as previously described, not allowed in certain parts of an assignment, handling overlaps with the assigned-to variable parts in the dimension access of a *VariableAccess* (as shown in the example below) needs special consideration:

  .. code-block:: text

    module main(inout a(4), in b[3](2))
        a[0].1:2 += b[(a[0].0:2 + 2)]

  The reversibility of the assignment depends on whether the expression in the dimension access on the right-hand side of the assignment can be synthesized without leading to an assignment in which a qubit is assigned to itself (i.e. *a[0].1 += a[0].1*). Thus, the user must specify via the :doc:`parser configuration <library/Settings>` whether an overlapping access on the assigned to variable parts is allowed in a dimension access. By default, such an access is assumed to be not allowed. The same restrictions also apply to both sides of a *SwapStatement* with the validity of the *SwapStatements* in the example below depending on the used parser configuration.

  .. code-block:: text

    module main(inout a(4), in b[3](2))
        b[(a[0].0:2 + 2)] <=> a[0].1:2;
        a[0].1:2 <=> b[(a[0].0:2 + 2)]

.. note::
 The overlap checks in many cases require that the checked indices evaluate to constant values at compile time (with the value of loop variables not being evaluated [except for loops performing a single iteration]) while in all other cases either no or a potential overlap is reported. Additionally, the parser will only report overlaps detected at compile time thus no overlap being reported does not indicate the absence of an overlap, as the following example shows:

 .. code-block:: text

   module main(inout a(4))
    for $i = 0 to (#a - 1) do
     a.0 += (a.$i + 2)
    rof

 The parser will not report an overlap in the assignment due to the index of the accessed bit in the *VariableAccess* on the right-hand side of the assignment not evaluating to a constant at compile time. However, the first iteration of the loop will generate an assignment of the form (*a.0 += (a.0 + 2)*) which cannot be reversed. We recommend also implementing overlap checks in any component using the generated IR representation of the SyReC program that could evaluate the value range of loop variables, e.g. in the logic synthesis process.

Call-/UncallStatements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- The current implementation does not require that the module referenced by a *Call/UncallStatement* must be defined at a position prior to the currently processed *Call/UncallStatement* in the SyReC program.
- A *CallStatement* will execute the referenced module starting from the first statement up to and including the last statement defined in its module body while an *UncallStatement* will perform an execution in the reverse direction with both semantics being inherited from the predecessor language of SyReC (see Janus :footcite:p:`yokoyama2007janus`).
- Recursive module calls are allowed but it is the responsibility of the developer of the SyReC program to prevent an infinite recursion. However, calls to the implicitly or explicitly defined main module of the SyReC program are not allowed.

 .. note::
  Recursive calls to overloads of the implicitly defined main module are possible as long as the last module of the SyReC program is not called.

  .. code-block:: text

   module add(in a(4), in b(4), out c(4))
    c += (a + b)

   // Implicitly defined main module
   module add(in a(8), in b(8), out c(8))
    wire tmp_1(4), tmp_2(4), wire tmp_3(4)

    tmp_1 ^= a.0:3;
    tmp_2 ^= b.0:3;
    call add(tmp_1, tmp_2, tmp_3); // Call OK -> module add(in a(4), ...) called
    c.0:4 ^= tmp_3;
    call add(a, b, c) // Call NOK -> implicit main module called

- While the SyReC parser allows a variable to be used multiple times as a caller argument in a *Call/UncallStatement*, it is for now the responsibility of the user to prevent non-reversible assignments in the called module. An example of such an invalid access is shown in the following example:

  .. code-block:: text

    module swap(inout left(4), inout right(4))
        left <=> right

    module main(inout a(4))
        // Call will result in access on assigned to variables parts
        // on both sides of SwapStatement (a <=> a)
        call swap(a, a)

ForStatement
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- While the SyReC grammar in the reference documents does not specify the keyword *do* prior to the body of a ForStatement, the examples shown in said documents all use this keyword and thus, we assume that this is a typo in the grammar and the *do* keyword is required.
- The initial value of a loop variable can be used in the initialization of the iteration ranges 'end' and 'stepsize' value as shown in the following example:

  .. code-block:: text

    module main(...)
        for $i = 0 to ($i + 1) step ($i + 2) do
            ...
        rof

    // Is equivalent to
    module main(...)
        for $i = 0 to 1 step 2 do
            ...
        rof

- The identifier of a loop variable (excluding the dollar sign prefix) is allowed to be equal to the one of another variable as long as the latter is not a loop variable defined in a parent loop:

  .. code-block:: text

    // Loop variable identifier equal to identifier of module parameter
    module main(inout a(4), in i(2))
        for $i = 0 to (#a - 1) do
            a.0:1 += (i + $i)
        rof

   module main(inout a(4))
        for $i = 0 to (#a - 1) do
           // Loop variable identifier matches the one of parent loop => Error
           for $i = 0 to (#a - 1) do
              ++= a
           rof
        rof


- Due to the requirement that the number of iterations performed by a ForStatement is known at compile time, assignments to loop variables are forbidden.
- If the step size of a ForStatement is not defined, it is assumed to equal 1.
- If the user does not specify a loop variable definition or start-end-value iteration range pair but only a single *Number* component then it is assumed that this *Number* defines the end value of the iteration range while the start value is assumed to be equal to 0.
  Note that this assumptions also holds if the user defines a negative stepsize. The following example showcases two equivalent loop definitions, one only specifying a single *Number* component while the other defines the start-end-stepsize triple in the loop header:

  .. code-block:: text

    module main(inout a(4))
        for (#a - 1) do
            --= a
        rof

    // Is equivalent to
    module main(inout a(4))
        for 0 to (#a - 1) step 1 do
            --= a
        rof

- Due to the assumption that all variable values can be represented by unsigned integer values, negative step size values are converted to their unsigned value using the C++17 value conversion semantics (see `chapter 7.8 <https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/standards>`_). The same conversion is applied to all negative values determined at compile time.
- Semantic/Syntax errors in the statements of the body of a loop performing no iterations are reported due to the parser not implementing the dead code elimination technique.
- The iteration range of SyReC loops can be determined as shown in the following example:

  .. code-block:: text

   module main(inout a(32))
     // Loop will perform three iterations (loop variable *$i* will have values :math:`0, 2, 4`).
     for $i = 0 to 5 step 2 do
       ++= a
     rof

    // Equivalent C loop
    unsigned int a = ...;
    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < 5; i += 2) {
      ++= a
    }

    // Loop will perform three iterations (loop variable *$i* will have values :math:`5, 3, 1`). 
    for $i = 5 to 0 step 2 do 
        ++= a
    rof

- The value of the step size of a ForStatement cannot be defined as or evaluate to 0 to prevent an infinite loop.

IfStatement
^^^^^^^^^^^
- The components of an IfStatement will be referred to as *if <GUARD_CONDITION> then <TRUE_BRANCH> else <FALSE_BRANCH> fi <CLOSING_GUARD_CONDITION*. To be able to identify the matching guard condition for a closing guard condition, the expressions used to define both of these components must consist of the same characters (with an expression evaluating to the same value while consisting of different or additional characters not being considered equal). An example of an IfStatement violating this rule is the following:

  .. code-block:: text

    module main(inout a(4), in b(2))
        if ((a.0 + b.1) * 2) then
            skip
        else
            skip
        // Despite the simplified closing guard condition evaluating to the same
        // expression as the guard condition, the two expressions are not
        // considered equal due to the difference in the operands '2' and '#b'
        // between the two expressions
        fi ((a.0 + b.1) * #b)

- Semantic/Syntax errors in any simplified expression of either the guard or closing guard conditions are reported even if the violating expression can be omitted due to a simplification.
- Semantic/Syntax errors in the not executed branch of an IfStatement are reported due to the parser not implementing the dead code elimination optimization technique.
- The bitlength of the expression defined in the guard as well as closing guard condition must evaluate to 1.

SwapStatement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Both operands of the swap operation must have the same bitwidth.
- Whether the access on the assigned to variable parts in the dimension access of any *VariableAccess* on the opposite side of the SwapStatement is allowed depends on the value of the corresponding flag in the parser configuration (see :doc:`flag <library/Settings>`).
- Assignments to the same variable parts between the two sides of the SwapStatement are not allowed and a semantic error is reported if the parser can detect such an overlap.

VariableAccess
--------------
- All indices defined in the dimension or bit/bitrange access of a variable access are zero-based.
- The dimension access can be omitted for variables with a single dimension containing only a single value (i.e., *module main(inout a(4)) ++= a*).
- If the accessed bit/bitrange is omitted then an access on the full bitwidth of the referenced variable is assumed.
-  If the value of an index in either the dimension or bit/bitrange access evaluates to a constant at compile time, a validation of whether it is within the defined bounds of the accessed variable is performed and an error reported in case of an out-of-range value.
- Each expression defining the accessed value of the dimension will use an expected operand bitwidth for its operands that is only valid until the expression was processed. Any already existing expected operand bitwidth from outside of the expression is ignored (i.e. set in the parent expression of the currently processed *VariableAccess*). Assuming that the expression of the first accessed dimension of the *VariableAccess* on the right-hand side of the assignment in the following example is processed:

  .. code-block:: text

    module main(inout a[2](4), in c[2][3](4), in b(2))
      a[0].1:2 += c[(b.0 + 2)][a[1]].0:1

  The expected operand bitwidth set by the *VariableAccess* on the left-hand side of the assignment has a length of 2, which is satisfied by the *VariableAccess* on the right-hand side.
  However, the expected operand bitwidth of the operands in the expression of the first dimension of the *VariableAccess* on *c* has a value of 1, while for the second dimension it is equal to 4.

- The SyReC parser does not require that the start index of a bit range access be larger or equal to the end index and thus supports the following index combinations:

  .. code-block:: text

    module main(inout a(4))
        ++= a.0:2;
        --= a.2:0;
        ++= a.0:0

- The number of indices accessed in the dimension access component of a *VariableAccess* must be equal to the number of dimensions of the referenced variable. An example of a valid and invalid DimensionAccesses is shown below:

  .. code-block:: text

   module main(inout a[2][4](4), inout b(2))
     ++= a[0][1]; // OK
     --= b;       // OK
     ++= a[0]     // NOK: Number of accessed dimension does not match number of dimensions of variable 'a'

Expressions
-----------
- **Currently UnaryExpressions are not supported!**.
- Expressions with constant operands are evaluated at compile time.
- Arithmetic and logical simplifications are applied at compile time by default (i.e., will result in a simplification of the expression ((a + b) * 0) to 0). However, semantic/syntax errors in the operands of even the simplified subexpressions are reported with the following code sample showcasing an example:

  .. code-block:: text

   module main(inout a[2](4))
     a[0] += ((a[2] + 2) * (#a - 4))

  While the right-hand side expression of the assignment is simplified to the integer constant *0*, the semantic error causes by the out-of-range index access in the *VariableAccess* *a[2]* is still reported.

- All operands of an expression must have the same bitwidth (excluding constant integers which are truncated to the expected bitwidth using the :doc:`configured truncation operation <library/Settings>`), with the parser using the first bitrange with known bounds as the reference bitwidth (if such an access exists in the operands). Any bit access will set the expected operand bitwidth of a *VariableAccess* to 1.

  .. note::
    Logical and relational operations will 'truncate' the expected bitwidth of its result to 1.


  - The following table will showcase the expected operand bitwidth for each operand as well as subexpression of the right-hand side expression of the defined assignment:

    .. code-block:: text

     module main(inout a(6), in b(3))
      a.0 += (((a.1:3 + 2) > b) || (a.1 != 1))

    Note that while the expected operand bitwidth of the top-most expression is equal to 1, the operands in one of its subexpressions *((a.1:3 + 2) > b)* are allowed to have a different bitwidth due to the relational operation *>* causing the result to be aggregated into a 1-bit result thus satisfying the expected operand bitwidth for the logical OR operation of the parent expression.

    +----------------------------------+--------------------------------+

    +----------------------------------+--------------------------------+
    | ((a.1:3 + 2) > b) || (a.1 != 1)) | 1                              |
    +----------------------------------+--------------------------------+

- All integer constant values are truncated to the expected operand bitwidth, if the latter exists for the expression; otherwise, the values are left unchanged. However, integer constant values defined in the shift amount component of a *ShiftExpression* are not truncated since they modify the left-hand side of the *ShiftExpression* and "build" the result instead of being an operand of the overall expression.

  The following code example will showcase a few examples and assumes that constant integer values are truncated using the modulo operation

  .. code-block:: text

    module main(inout a[2](4), in b(2), in c(4))
        // Expected operand bitwidth set by a[0].0:1 to 2
        a[0].0:1 += (b + 4);
        for $i = 0 to (#a - 1) do
            // Expected operand bitwidth set by a[(b + 2) + 5].$i to 1

  The SyReC program above is transformed to

  .. code-block:: text

    module main(inout a[2](4), in b(2), in c(4))
        // 4 MOD 3 = 1
        a[0].0:1 += (b + 1);
        for $i = 0 to (#a - 1) do
            // 3 MOD 1 = 0 causes simplification of right-hand side expression
            // Note that the expression ((b + 2) + 5) uses a separate expected
            // operand bitwidth of 2 and is simplified to (b + 2).
            // Constant operand (3) of right-hand side of assignment is simplified to zero:
            //  3 MOD 3 = 0 and 5 MOD 3 = 2
            a[(b + 2)].$i += (c.$i + b.0);
            // 5 MOD 7 => 1
            a[1].0:($i + 2) += (b.2:0 + 5)
            // Expected operand bitwidth of 2 causes simplification of (b << 4) to 0
            // since shift amount is larger than expected bitwidth
            // Remaining expression 2 << 1 evaluated to 4 => 4 MOD 3 = 1
            a[0].1:2 += 1;
            // Expected operand bitwidth of 4 for original expression E1 (a[1] > 5) does not modify original operand 5 MOD 15 = 5.
            a[0].0 += ((a[1] > 5) || (b != c.0:1));
            // Expected operand bitwidth for original expression E1 (a[1].1:2 + 5) causes truncation of 5 MOD 3 = 2.
            // Expected operand bitwidth for original expression E2 (a[1] != 18) causes truncation of 18 MOD 15 = 3.
            // Expected operand bitwidth of expression E3 = (E1 || E2) is equal to 1.
            // The subexpressions E1 does not satisfy the expected operand bitwidth of the logical OR operation
            // and thus the right-hand side expression of the assignment is not semantically correct
            a[0].1 += ((a[1].1:2 + 2) || (a[1] != 3))
        rof

  Setting the expected operand bitwidth for one of the operands of an expression that was previously not known will cause an execution of the integer constant truncation in said operand:

  .. code-block:: text

   // Original SyReC program
   module main(inout a[2](4), in b(2))
    for $i = 0 to (#a - 2) do
      // Expected operand bitwidth of expression (a[1].$i:($i + 1) + 2) is unknown
      // Expected operand bitwidth of expression (b + 2) is equal to 2
      a[0]:1 += (((a[1].$i:($i + 1) + 4) + (b + 5)) || a[0].2)
    rof

   // Original SyReC program (after integer constant truncation)
   module main(inout a[2](4), in b(2))
    for $i = 0 to (#a - 2) do
      a[0]:1 += (((a[1].$i:($i + 1) + 1) + (b + 2)) || a[0].2)
    rof

- The following enumeration defines how the right-hand side operand of the supported integer constant truncation operations is calculated for a expected operand bitwidth :math:`b`:

  * Bitwise AND:  :math:`2^{b} - 1`
  * Modulo:       :math:`2^{b} - 1`

- Expressions with constant integer operands are evaluated using the C++ semantics for unsigned integers.
- Operands of expressions using the relational ('<', '>', '<=', '>=', '=', '!=') or logical ('||', '&&') operations must to have a bitwidth equal to 1.

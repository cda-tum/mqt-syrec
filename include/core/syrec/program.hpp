         * @brief Is access on the assigned to variable parts allowed in the dimension access components of variable accesses defined in the operands of the assignment.

         * @details An issue encountered during the implementation of the parser was to define whether the variable parts of the be assigned variable can be used in its own dimension access (self-reference) <br>
         * or in the one on the other side of the assignment. <br>
         * An example for a 'self-reference' could be the simple assignment:  <br>
         * I.       module main(inout a[2](4)) ++= a[a[0]]  <br>
         * While a reference on the other side of an assignment could look like:  <br>
         * II.      module main(inout a[2](4), out b[2](4)) a[b[0]] <=> b[0] or a[0] += b[a[0]]  <br><br>
         * To guarantee the reversibility of an assignment, the parser checks that the assigned to variable parts are not accessed on the other side of an assignment thus an assignment of the form:  <br>
         * III.     module main(inout a[2](4)) a[0] += (a[0] + 2)  <br>
         * is not allowed, while the reversibility of the examples I. and II. depend on the implemented synthesis of the expressions defining the accessed value of the dimensions. Thus, the user needs to define whether variable accesses  <br>
         * as shown in the examples I. and II. are allowed via the corresponding flag in the parser configuration. However, the parser can only verify this check if all indices of the assigned to variable access evaluate to constant values with  <br>
         * the same requirement for the indices for any potentially violating variable access in a dimension access (thus the parser will only report cases where it can prove that an overlap exists).  <br>
         * Examples that are not reported as overlaps are:  <br>
         * I.      module main(inout a[2](4)) ++= a[a[0]]  <br>
         * II.     module main(inout a[2](4)) for $i = 0 to 1 do a[$i] += a[0] rof  <br>
         * III.    module main(inout a[2](4)) for $i = 0 to 1 do a[0] += a[$i] rof

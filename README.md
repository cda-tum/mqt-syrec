# SyReC Synthesizer: An MQT Tool for the Synthesis of Reversible Circuits

A tool for HDL-based synthesis of reversible circuits developed by the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/).
The _SyReC Synthesizer_ is part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) and builds upon [our quantum functionality representation (QFR)](https://github.com/cda-tum/qfr).

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via [quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de](mailto:quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de) or by creating an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/cda-tum/syrec/issues).

## Getting Started

The _SyReC Synthesizer_ is available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.syrec/) for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

- In order to make the library as easy to use as possible (without compilation), we provide pre-built wheels for most common platforms (64-bit Linux, MacOS, Windows). These can be installed using
  ```bash
  (venv) $ pip install mqt.syrec
  ```
- Once installed, start the _SyReC Synthesizer_ GUI by running:
  ```bash
  (venv) $ syrec-editor
  ```

**Detailed documentation on all available methods, options, and input formats is available at [ReadTheDocs](https://syrec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).**

## System Requirements and Building

The implementation is compatible with any C++17 compiler and a minimum CMake version of 3.14.
Please refer to the [documentation](https://syrec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on how to build the project.

Building (and running) is continuously tested under Linux, macOS, and Windows using the [latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments).
